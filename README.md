# my-knowledge
My name is Iniya. I am presently the second-year student at SRM Valliammai Engineering College in Chennai majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. .
 Besides the knowledgeÂ  of programming languages particularly Python, SQL, HTML, C, and C++ I&m enthusiastic about coding and is willing to put them in practical applications in the real world. Through my learning with much joy, my strength is not only to make well-constructed prompts but also to my knowledge of the current AI trends, representing a proactive step to the practice of staying current in this fast-evolving field. Recognized not only as a cautious person but also seen as a person with the need for the work to be perfect I stand for the idea that by completing tasks in a perfect way one can become more efficient and better at it.
